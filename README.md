# Quiz Mini Game

## Description

The purpose of this project is to learn how to create a functioning quiz game. By using JavaScript, this application displays an understanding of how to use JS in order to create a dynamic page that renders one question at a time until a user clicks on an answer button. The application also features a functioning timer during the quiz and a user score submit form. The motivation for this project was to practice using JavaScript to become more proficient in utilizing intervals, form submits, local storage, and user functionality. This project solves the issue of learning how JavaScript can be used to add logic that will render an application that users can interact with to play a quiz mini game and save their scores locally. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the application properly, click on the "Start" button to begin the quiz. Once the quiz begins, the page will render a timer that counts down and a question/answer prompt from which users can select their answer. After selecting an answer, the page will prompt the next question and answer choices. The timer will continue to run down during the duration of the quiz, subtracting 10 seconds each time the user selects the wrong answer. Each correct answer will award 10 points with a maximum score of 100. At the end of the quiz, the application will render the user's total score and prompt a form that can be submitted to store high scores locally in the browser. 

##Credits

Instructor Diarmuid Murphy for the assistance in writing code that helps render questions on the page one at a time, displaying only the current question onto the page; Mr. Murphy also inspired the method in which user answer selection will interact with the timer and the following question. Developer Mozilla (MDN) gave instruction on how to properly use variables and values from objects stored in an array.
